# Hi there, I'm Nazar Babii! üëã

## üëÄ About Me  
AI/ML Engineer and Full-Stack Developer with over 8 years of experience designing, deploying, and optimizing cutting-edge AI systems across finance, healthcare, legal, and entertainment sectors. I specialize in building intelligent, context-aware assistants using **LLM-based architectures**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**, and **Agent-Oriented AI frameworks**.

My recent work involves implementing **Deep Research Agents** for automating legal and academic research, designing **Agent2Agent communication protocols** for multi-agent collaboration, and integrating **Model Context Protocols** for scalable, memory-aware systems. I incorporate **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** workflows to iteratively refine outputs and improve reliability across sensitive use cases.

Proven track record includes boosting LLM accuracy by 20% using custom RAG pipelines on GCP, increasing YOLOv8 inference performance 4x for edge devices, and developing robust CI/CD and MLOps pipelines for cloud-native AI applications. I'm highly skilled with GPT, Claude, LangChain, FAISS, and modern deployment stacks, passionate about building high-impact AI systems that adapt, scale, and deliver real-world value.
